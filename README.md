I am a postdoc at the [Princeton University C-PREE](https://cpree.princeton.edu/people/lisa-thalheimer) researching human responses to climate change. I use attribution studies to understand climate-related population movements and build anticipatory action models. Please get in touch or see [my bio page](https://lisathalheimer.github.io/) for more details! :trollface:
